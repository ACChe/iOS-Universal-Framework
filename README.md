iOS Universal Framework Examples
================================

In this branch are various examples showing how universal frameworks may be integrated into your workflow.

**Note**: These examples are all built using the Mk 8 beta, which currently works for most use cases, with the notable exception of command-line building of a project containing other project dependencies.


### List of examples:

* **basic-framework-in-app**: Creating, distributing, and using a universal framework
* **linked-with-library**: Linking a fat static library or framework into your own static framework
* **nib-in-framework**: Distributing a universal embedded framework containing resources (in this case a nib)
